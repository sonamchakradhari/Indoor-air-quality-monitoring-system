# Indoor-air-quality-monitoring-system
Using Raspberry, co2 sensor(mhz19-b), dust sensor(sm-pwm-01c) we tried to figure out concentartion of co2 and dust particle int air. This project is based on Indoor air quality monitoring. We put up data to the Thingspeak( an open source cloud dashboard) and got real time data in the graphical form.
