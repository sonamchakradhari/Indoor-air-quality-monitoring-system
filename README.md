Using Raspberry, co2 sensor(mhz19-b), dust sensor(sm-pwm-01c) we tried to figure out concentartion of co2 and dust particle in the air. We put up data to the Thingspeak( an open source cloud dashboard) and got real time data in the graphical form.We have used datasheets of the above mentioned sensors to make code.
